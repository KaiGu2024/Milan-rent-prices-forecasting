# Milan-rent-prices-forecasting
The dataset consists of information from7334 rent announcements inMilan posted in Immobiliare.it.
For 4500 of these announcements you know the corresponding rent price [denoted as y], and you have
additional input variables describing several features of the house/apartment. For the other 2834 rent
